# ReadMe File - Important that you read this!!
**The Application**
- The application is a simple prototype for a robot cleaning system. In order to run the code you have to follow the steps below and install a program called Xampp.
---
**Steps in installing and running the app**
1) Dowload and Install Xampp - https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html
(If problems start to emerge with the program, I would suggest installing an older version.)

2) Move the folder containing the application to the Xampp folder under another other named htdocs.
(The folder needs to be within the htdocs folder for it to run.)

3) Start the Zampp control panel. Click start on both the Apache and MySQL sections.

4) Copy & Paste following url into your browser in order to arrive at the starting page - http://localhost/Cobot/
(Cobot because that is the name of the folder containing the app. If the name is changed or something extra has been included, then those changes also need to made in the url accordingly for it to be the real path.)

Follow these steps and the app/code should run as expected.

**Another important note!**
